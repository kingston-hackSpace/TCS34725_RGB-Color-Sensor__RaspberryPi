# TCS34725_RGB-Color-Sensor__RasberryPi

The [TCS34725 RGB sensor](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-color-sensors/overview) provides a digital return of red, green, blue (RGB), and clear light sensing values. An RGB Color sensor helps you accurately detect an object’s colour in your interactive projects.

**TCS34725 on-board white LED**

Used to provide constant illumination. 

The LED pin can be pulled low to turn off the LED. This can be done by:

  1. Wiring directly to ground to turn it off completely.
     
  2. Wiring to a spare digital pin and control it with digitalWrite().

----
   
- Download the corresponding libraries [Adafruit_TCS34725](https://github.com/CamilaColussi-KSA/Adafruit_TCS34725)

- Install the libraries via "Importing a .zip Library". Instructions [here](https://docs.arduino.cc/software/ide-v1/tutorials/installing-libraries/)

- Open Arduino IDE and find the sensor examples:
   - File > Examples > Adafruit TCS34725 > tcs34725

- Upload the code to your Arduino board.

- Open Arduino's Serial Monitor to see the incoming data.

### UNDERSTANDING THE VALUES

Based on the TCS34725 library, we can use specific functions to read the following parameters:

**Color Temperature (measured in Kelvin)**

  Typical range:

      1,500–3,000 K → warm / yellow

      3,000–5,000 K → neutral white

      5,000–7,000 K → cool daylight

      7,000–10,000+ K → very blue-ish light
  
**Lux (Lumens per Square Meter)**

*The TCS34725 can read up to about 40k–50k lux before saturating*, depending on settings.

    Typical range:

      0–10 lux → very dark

      10–100 lux → dim indoor light

      100–1,000 lux → normal indoor light

      1,000–10,000 lux → outdoors shade

      10,000–100,000 lux → bright sunlight
  
**Clear Light (unfiltered) value**

The TCS34725 measures light using a 16-bit ADC (analogue-to-digital converter).

A 16-bit number can count from:

    - 0 (no light detected)

    - to 65,535 (maximum)

  Typical range:

    0–2,000 → dim or dark

    2,000–10,000 → normal indoor lighting

    10,000–40,000 → bright room or daylight

    40,000+ → very bright / outdoor sun

    65,535 → too bright (saturation)


**R, G and B values**

The TCS34725 sensor doesn’t output human-readable colour names. Instead, it provides raw digital values via a 16-bit ADC (analogue-to-digital converter), representing the intensity of red, green, and blue light detected.

These raw values give a reference of colour predominance — for example, if the red channel is much higher than green or blue, the object is likely red. However, for consistent comparisons, it is recommended to normalise these values (e.g., scale according to total light intensity or to a standard 0–255 range).

The 16-bit RGB raw values can range from:

    - 0 to 65,535

### Colour reading TIPS

- Place different objects in front of the sensor to perform colour readings. See reference [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQnzRW4XukA&t=5s)
  
- The closer and more centred, the more accurate the colour reading.

- If your object is too far or at an angle, readings may be weak or uneven.

- The TCS34725 LED helps reduce ambient light interference. The LED provides constant and stable illumination.

## TUTORIAL 2: Calibrating the sensor for accurate readings

- Upload [this code](https://github.com/kingston-hackSpace/TCS34725_RGB-Color-Sensor/blob/main/RGB_Sensor_RGB-cal.ino) to your Arduino board.

- Open the Arduino Serial Monitor to see the incoming data.
  
- Place a matte-pure-white-card close to the sensor (usually 5–10 mm away).
  
- Make sure the sensor’s illumination LED is on.
  
- With the card still covering the sensor, press the **RESET** button on the Arduino. The Arduino code will reload, allowing us to collect a baseline of white readings.

- Look at the Serial Monitor and wait until the calibration is completed.

- You now will see new values with calibrated data.

- The new sensor values represent:

  - Raw RGB readings + Raw Brightness(C) (0 - 65,535)
    
  - RGB percentages (%) as normalised values (0.0 - 1.0)
    
  - Normalised brightness values (0.0 - 1.0)
